===== How to run the examples =====

Copy the AeTrayMenu.exe executable into the example's subdirectory, and then run it. AeTrayMenu.exe will automatically load the AeTrayMenu.ini file it finds in the same directory --- or, for that matter, any .ini file with the same filename as its own executable.
