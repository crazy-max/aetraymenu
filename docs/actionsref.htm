AeTrayMenu can perform certain <em>actions</em> when <a href="sectmenu.htm">menu items</a> are clicked by the user. There are also other places where actions appear, such as the <a href="sectdoubleclick.htm">[DoubleClickAction]</a> section, and <a href="sectbatch.htm">batch action sections</a>.
</p>
<p>
First of all, you often need to specify which action you want to have performed by specifying an <code>Action</code> <a href="params.htm">parameter</a>. Furthermore, some actions also require additional parameters.
</p>
<p>
The following is a list of all the available action types along with a description. Actions that need additional parameters will be explained in more detail in separate topics.
</p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>about</dt>
<dd>Displays the AeTrayMenu about dialog.</dd>
<dt><a name="closeservices">closeservices</a></dt>
<dd>In order to be able to monitor the services you've specified, AeTrayMenu keeps handles open to them. If you want to uninstall a service from within the traymenu, this will cause it to be "marked for deletion" (that is: it won't be fully removed until a reboot) since Windows detects it's still in use. By executing the <code>closeservices</code> action, you can make sure AeTrayMenu won't interfere. You can let AeTrayMenu re-open the handles by executing the <a href="#resetservices.htm"><code>resetservices</code></a> action.<br />
If you want to uninstall a service from an external program while AeTrayMenu is running, you can use <a href="cmdline.htm">command-line parameters</a> to temporarily shut the traymenu down.</dd>
<dt><a name="controlpanelservices">controlpanelservices</a></dt>
<dd>Displays the "Services" console (on NT systems, you can open it by going to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services).</dd>
<dt>exit</dt>
<dd>Shuts down AeTraymenu.</dd>
<dt>multi</dt>
<dd>Provides you with a way to execute multiple actions consecutively, much like Windows/DOS batch files. <a href="actmulti.htm">More information...</a> (See also <a href="usebatch.htm">How to Use Batch Actions</a>).
<dt>readconfig</dt>
<dd>This actions lets AeTrayMenu reset itself and reload its configuration file.
<dt><a name="resetservices">resetservices</a></dt>
<dd>Causes AeTrayMenu to reset all its handles to the services it monitors. Can e.g. be used to 'restore' the traymenu after a call to the <code>closeservices</code> action.</dd>
<dt>run</dt>
<dd>With this type of action, you can run a program. You can specify which program is to be executed, along with the working directory, parameters etc. <a href="actrun.htm">More information...</a></dd>
<dt>service</dt>
<dd>Allows you to start, stop, suspend, resume and restart services. <a href="actserv.htm">More information...</a></dd>
<dt>shellexecute</dt>
<dd>This action is similar to the <code>run</code> action, but it can also be used to open documents with their associated programs. <a href="actshellexec.htm">More information...</a></dd>
