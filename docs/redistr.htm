The main purpose of AeTrayMenu is that it may be redistributed for use in other software packages. You are completely free to use it both in commercial and non-commercial packages (see the <a href="license.htm">License Agreement</a>). There are a couple of technical and non-technical issues you may consider when redistributing AeTrayMenu:
</p>
<p>
<h2>Files You Need</h2>
Since all thirdparty libraries AeTrayMenu uses are linked to the executable, you'll only need to include the following files:
<ul>
<li><strong>The AeTrayMenu executable</strong> - If you want, you can rename the executable to suit your wishes and needs.</li>
<li><strong>The configuration file</strong> - In most cases, it's the most convenient to name this file <code>&lt;name of the AeTrayMenu executable&gt;.ini</code>.</li>
<li><strong>An imagelist bitmap</strong> - You must specify the filename of this bitmap in the <a href="configimagelist.htm"><code>ImageList</code></a> directive. You could name this file <code>&lt;name of the AeTrayMenu executable&gt;.dat</code>.</li>
<li>If you have specified one or more sidebar images in the <a href="sectmenusettings.htm">[Menu.*.Settings]</a> sections, you'll have to include those bitmaps as well.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Installing the Traymenu</h2>
The program doesn't need a special installation, but you might consider the following:
<ul>
<li>Be sure to close the traymenu using the <code>-quit</code> <a href="cmdline.htm">command-line parameter</a> if there's a chance that your installer will attempt to overwrite the traymenu's executable while it's running.</li>
<li>If you want the traymenu to run at Windows startup, you can place a shortcut in the <em>Startup</em> folder in the Start menu. You can also use the <code>HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code> registry key (or the same key under <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2>The About Box</h2>
As you've probably seen, you can easily leave AeTrayMenu's About box out of the traymenu. You're allowed to do so, but I would appreciate it if you'd put a menu item with the <a href="actionsref.htm"><code>about</code></a> action somewhere.
