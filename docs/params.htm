All of the sections in a script, with the exception of <a href="sectconfig.htm">[Config]</a>, <a href="sectmsg.htm">[Messages]</a> and <a href="sectmenusettings">[Menu.*.Settings]</a>, contain lines separated into <dfn>parameters</dfn>. The following is an example of a <a href="sectvar.htm">[Variables]</a> section:
<samp>
[Variables]
Name: MyAppVersion; Type: static; Value: &quot;version 1.0&quot;
Name: MyAppPath; Type: registry; Root: HKLM; Key: &quot;Software\MyApp&quot;; ValueName: InstallPath; Flags: ispath
</samp>
</p>
<p>
Each parameter consists of a name, followed by a colon, and then a value. Unless otherwise noted, parameters are optional in that they assume a default value if they are not specified. Multiple parameters on a line are separated by a semicolons, and can be listed in any order.
</p>
<p>
The value of a parameter is traditionally surrounded in double quotes (<code>&quot;</code>) when it contains a user-defined string, such as a filename. Using quotes is not required, though, but by doing so it makes it possible to embed leading and trailing spaces in the value, as well as semicolons and double-quote characters.
</p>
<p>
To embed a double-quote character inside a quoted value, use two consecutive double-quote characters. For example:
<samp>
&quot;This &quot;&quot; contains &quot;&quot; embedded &quot;&quot; quotes&quot;
</samp>
AeTrayMenu would see that as: <code>This &quot; contains &quot; embedded &quot; quotes</code>
</p>
<p>
If you want the value of a parameter to be a single double-quote character, use four double-quote characters: <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>. The outer two are needed to surround the string in quotes; the inner two are used to embed a single double-quote character.
